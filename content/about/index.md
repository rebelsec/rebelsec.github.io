My name is **Galatia Sijabat**, and I have a strong interest in the world of computing. I am currently focusing on the field of cyber security. The content I write here may help you get a better understanding of what cyber security is (although I am still learning myself). These writings also serve as personal notes that I can revisit whenever I need references to topics I have explored before.

## Web Application Security Enthusiast

---

A **Web Application Security Enthusiast**—abbreviated as **WASE**—is part of the broader discipline of cyber security.

Here are some branches of cyber security:

- Network Security  
- Cloud Security  
- Endpoint Security  
- Mobile Security  
- IoT Security  
- Application Security  
- Zero Trust  

Among these areas, I am particularly interested in **Application Security**, specifically **Web Application Security (Red Team)**. That is why this blog focuses largely on topics related to Web Application Security. It may not be perfect, but as Julius Caesar once said:  
**“It is better to fail in battle than to fail without ever drawing your sword.”**
